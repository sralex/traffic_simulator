# Netlogo Nagel + BML, traffic simulator

This project is part of my master's degree exam. It is basically a traffic simulator to evaluate the implementation of a bio-inspired algorithm (ant colony) as a decentralized routing strategy.

Here you can find my thesis, [https://ru.dgb.unam.mx/handle/DGB_UNAM/TES01000780522](https://ru.dgb.unam.mx/handle/DGB_UNAM/TES01000780522), and here an article related [10.13053/rcs-147-8-19](https://www.rcs.cic.ipn.mx/2018_147_8/Algoritmo%20descentralizado%20de%20ruteo%20de%20trafico%20vehicular%20con%20informacion%20local.pdf)

The main objective is to simulate trips from one point to another indefinitely, this allows to determine how much the algorithm implementation can improve the flow, use IBM for intersections, and Nagel for everything else.

## How to use

## Prerequisites

* Netlogo 6.1

## Instructions

Open the netlogo model located in src.
